          <p>There was a time when everything new in CSS was referred to as "CSS3".</p>
          <p>That era began well over a decade ago now, and it was really quite the buzzword for a number of years, receiving a huge amount of coverage.</p>
          <p>The term has somewhat fizzled out over the last few years, and rather than being displaced by a "CSS4", everyone just went back to calling it plain old CSS again.</p>
          <p>In fact, it was pretty categorically stated that there would never be a CSS4.</p>
          <p>To understand why (and why that may no longer be the case ðŸ˜„), we need to look at how CSS has evolved over time.</p>

        <p>After a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4770">GitHub discussion</a> spanning several years, the decision was made in November 2023 to start defining CSS4.</p>
        <p>There won't be any actual changes to the way the CSS specifications are worked on or the way in which they advance - the different modules will continue to progress independently at their own pace.</p>
        <p>The idea of batching these individual module levels into buckets of "CSS4", "CSS5" and so on, is purely for the benefit of the community, and the marketing benefits.</p>
        <p>It will eliminate any misconceptions that CSS is now stagnant (which couldn't be further from the truth), it will help devs learn, teachers teach, employers hire... there is a lot of potential upside.</p>
